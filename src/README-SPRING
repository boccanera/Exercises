Spring Boot vs Spring MVC vs Spring: What's in it?
·
Spring Framework: Dependency Injection
• @Component, @Autowired, Component Scan etc..
• Just Dependency Injection is NOT sufficient (You need other frameworks to build apps)

Spring Modules and Spring Projects: Extend Spring Eco System
• Provide good integration with other frameworks (Hibernate/JPA, JUnit & Mockito for Unit Testing)

Spring MVC (Spring Module): Simplify building web apps and REST API
• Building web applications with Struts was very complex
• @Controller, @RestController, @RequestMapping("/courses")

Spring Boot (Spring Project): Build PRODUCTION-READY apps QUICKLY
• Starter Projects - Make it easy to build variety of applications
• Auto configuration - Eliminate configuration to setup Spring, Spring MVC and other frameworks! • Enable non functional requirements (NFRs):
• Actuator: Enables Advanced Monitoring of applications
• Embedded Server: No need for separate application servers!
