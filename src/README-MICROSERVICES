GATEWAY - the clients access the url of the gateway and it will distribute the requests to the server (cloud or on premise).
It also provides a single entry point for all clients to interact with the system, allowing for better scalability,
security, and control over the APIs.

API Gateway handles common tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching, while also abstracting away the complexity of the underlying services.
Discovery server - load balancer (APP to register the instances and balance between them the overload of requests)

vertical growth = hardware (CPU, memory, hard drive)
horizontal growth = cloud (more servers as demand increases)
