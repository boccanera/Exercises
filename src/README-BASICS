Hash: transform one value into another based on a particular key. Converts the input into an output value usually
shorter. Nonetheless collision can occur, when two different inputs result in the same output.

Hashcode method: assign if the hashcode of the key will be equal.

Equals method: compare if the obj content isEqual

ex: new Student(1, "Bob") and new Student(1, "Bob") the key '1' is equal.

If you Override Equal, you must to override hashcode method. (if two objects are equal, you must return the same object).

If you don't override Hashcode, they will have different memory address and consequently different hashcode.
