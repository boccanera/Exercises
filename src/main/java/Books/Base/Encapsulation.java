The benefits of encapsulation for data protection include:

Access control: Through encapsulation, it is possible to define who can access or modify the data of a class. By making attributes private,
only the internal methods of the class have direct access to that data.

Hiding implementation details: Encapsulation allows the internal implementation of a class to be hidden from the external world.
This prevents other components or classes from depending directly on the internal structure of the class, facilitating code maintenance and evolution.

Validation and control: With access methods (getters and setters), you can add validations and control rules to ensure
the integrity and consistency of the data. For example, when defining a setter, you can add checks to prevent the assignment of invalid values.

Flexibility of evolution: By using encapsulation, the internal implementation of a class can be changed without affecting
the classes that depend on it. This allows for internal improvements or optimizations without breaking existing code that uses the class.

in depth:

Violation of Information Hiding: Encapsulation promotes information hiding by hiding the internal implementation details of a class.
By making attributes private, you explicitly declare that they should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
Directly accessing private attributes bypasses the intended interface (setters and getters) and exposes the internal implementation, which can lead to potential issues.

Lack of Data Validation and Business Logic: When accessing attributes through setter methods, you have the opportunity to enforce
data validation and implement business logic. For example, you can validate the input values, perform calculations, or trigger
certain actions when attributes are modified. By accessing the attribute directly, you bypass these validations and logic,
potentially resulting in inconsistent or invalid data.

Code Flexibility and Maintainability: Encapsulation provides flexibility in changing the internal implementation of a class without
affecting the external code that depends on it. When attributes are accessed directly, any change in the attribute's name, type,
or validation logic would require modifying every place where the attribute is accessed. This makes the code more brittle and harder to maintain.

Encapsulation as an Abstraction Barrier: Encapsulation acts as an abstraction barrier, separating the internal implementation from
the external usage of a class. By accessing private attributes directly, you break this barrier and tightly couple the external code
with the internal details of the class. This reduces code modularity and increases dependencies.
